            <h3>The Following Games Aren't In Any Specific Order, They're Just Some Of Them.</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>From AAA big production titles to smaller indie produced games they all hold a special place in my heart for different reasons, these are games I will never get bored of even if I don't play them for a long time, i can always come back to them and enjoy them instantly.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring" target="_blank">Elden Ring</a></h3>
                <p>An open-world RPG, being the latest release from Fromsoftware that is in this style. I have put over 200 hours since the game released back in February 25, 2022. I particularly love this game because im able to immerse myself into the huge world provided to the player, there is always something new to discover and new challenges to tackle, not only that but you can do it with friends if you chose to. overall I think this game is perfect if you want a good challenge, you want a beautiful world to explore in any way that you want, and you want a game you can replay multiple times and still get a different experience each time.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.nicalis.com/games/thebindingofisaacrepentance" target="_blank">The Binding Of Isaac</a></h3>
                <p>A Top-down, Action-Adventure, Dungeon Crawling, Roguelike. Much like with Elden Ring this game can provide you with new experiences every time you play it but on steroids, every time you play it's going to be different, going against different enemies, from being in different areas and even choosing different characters to play. To summarize the gameplay loop you basically play through the game unlocking new items every time you complete challenges, beat bosses, or get to new areas and any subsequent "runs" you have the chance of stumbling upon those items so that its easier to beat the game and get even more items for the following run. I have put hundreds of hours from playing on multiple comsoles, from my PS5 to my Switch and even on my PC. (if anything says how much I enjoy this game it's the fact that ive bought it at least 4 different times)</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.megacrit.com/" target="_blank">Slay The Spire</a></h3>
                <p>muchlike The Binding of Isaac this game is a roguelike dungeon crawler but instead of it being an Action/Adventure, top down game this one is a deck building, card game. It uses the same concepts as the Binding of isaac in the fact that every run you unlock more items/characters however its done with cards! Maybe the fact that I love these kinds of games that thrive off of chaos and randomness says something about me but I wont take the time to think about that right now. I love this game because of the same reasons as The Binding of Isaac, it's a time killer and super enjoyable to me.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://terraria.org/" target="_blank">Terraria</a></h3>
                <p>Finally A different type of game! Terraria! anyone that hasn't plauyed this game consideres it to just be a "2D Minecraft" but it's so much more than that, to the point that they aren't even comparable when you take a small peek inside. Terraria is an Action-Adventure Sandbox game however where this game diverges from the minecraft formula is that this game mostly focuses mostly on combat, bosses, and upgrading your character. the game is fantastic to play by yourself, you can spend hundreds of hours playing and replaying making new characters and worlds playing through with different classes each time, however where this game really shines is when playing in Co-op with other friends, it's a great experience when you can get 2 or 3 friends to join you in an adventure that can last as long as youre willing to play, if you somehow ever get bored of everything that the base game can offer there is an absolutely immense library of mods made by a very talented community. This game holds a very dear spot to me, i've been playing it since I was 11 back in 2011 and it still manages to keep me entertained and invested even after all these years. </p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/destiny" target="_blank">Destiny 2</a></h3>
                <p>"I HATE THIS GAME" if you have ever talked to anyone that plays this game you will, at some point, hear them say this. Destiny 2 is a First Person Shooter MMORPG Action-Adventure Game. I have spent probably over 1000 hours in this game since the release of the first game and the 2nd one, Destiny is a beautiful science fiction game full of "space magic" amd drama that will keep you at the edge of your sit if youre willing to spend the time to listen to the dialogue, watch the cutscenes, and read the item lore and lore cards provided. The game has a fantastic community that is welcoming and willing to teach new players mechanics and raids. I love and hate this game I love playing with friends and spending hours upon hours raiding and playing PVP but when the game has lows they are deeper than the Mariana Trench, I cannot recomment it for everyone but if some of the aspects i've described catch your attention and you're willing to put the time in I think you could really enjoy this game for a long time.</p>
