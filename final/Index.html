            <h3>Post Reflection!</h3>
            <p>After Completing the website I realized I had bit of trouble remembering some code I wanted to use from the beggining of class so i had to go back and review it, however besides that everything is starting to feel more straightforward. i have a good idea of the way I want to split my work to make it flow better and im getting more accostumed to searching for help online and being able to take code posted and being able to tweak and fix it to make it work with my code doing what i wanted it to.</p>
            <p>I learned a lot throughout this course, I had some very basic knowledge of html coming into the course from previous classes i've had so most of the stuff we went over and learned are completely new, CSS was completely new to me and I find that I really enjoy using it as it opens a lot of posibilities for stylizing your website.</p>
