                <h3>Dune (Series)</h3>
                <p>
                    Dune, written by Frank Herbert, and taken over by his son, Brian Herbert, after the 6th book from Frank. Dune is a science fiction Epic focused on enviromentalism, politics, and family. I have re-read the first 4 books multiple times and enjoy them just as much as i did the first time everytime, sometimes even more. I love the storytelling from Mr. Herbert and I could not imagine not reading these books from the impact they have had in my life.

                <h3><strong><font color="red">House</font></strong> of Leaves (Singular Book)</h3>
                <p>I will start off by saying that i have actually never finished reading this book front to back. however it is still one of my favorite books to <i>Try</i> and read. The book plays with the media itself and the way its used. being a horror book based on an unexplainable, impossible to comprehend <strong><font color="red">House</font></strong> the book begins to take on traits from the <strong><font color="red">House</font></strong> itself, the words lose structure paragraphs break apart and come back in different pages, windows open up in pages where you can look through and read on that window page after page, its a fun and truly unique experience to hold in your hands, I cant really go into detail about the ending of the book because i havent finished it and because the concept of the book itself is hard to explain but i think that if you want to read a book that is different from anything else while being truly intriguing i do recomment <strong><font color="red">House</font></strong> of Leaves.</p>

                <h3>Blood Meridian(singular Book)</h3>
                <p>Written by Cormac Mc Carthy, the author of other classics such as The Road and No Country for Old Men, Blood meridian puts you in the wild west at a time where war, gangs, and shootouts were an every day occurence for the people alive, we follow a kid that joins an indian scalp hunting gang lead by a mysterious and trully evil man,Judge Holden also known as just The Judge, we see the brutality and absolute stomach churning actions these people take from the eyes of a 14 year old kid, Mc Carthy is able to get the sheer brutality of the Judge through to the audience in a way that no one else can, it will keep you reading page after page even if it makes you feel sick, and trust me the actions taken by him and his gang are more than enough to make you sick if you have a weak stomach. Despite all this i truly do recommend Blood Meridian. </p>

                <h3>Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege, 1942â€“1943</h3>
                <p>Not much to say here, if you are a fan of military history, war history, or just learning about extreme places during extreme times and youre interested in history I think this book is up there for the best, its an indepth look at the battle of stalingrad, how the people were affected from the civilians to the soldiers themselves, its a grim read but one that is worth reading.</p>
